# Quantitative Finance Project

This project is designed as a learning platform for quantitative finance concepts using Python. It focuses on applying mathematical models and linear algebra to financial data, without the use of real money. The goal is to build, analyze, and visualize financial models using popular Python libraries.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Import and process historical financial data.
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Apply linear algebra and statistical models (e.g., Markowitz Portfolio Optimization, PCA).
- **Visualization:** Plot results for better understanding and presentation.
- **Simulation:** Backtest strategies using historical data.

## Mathematical Concepts

- **Linear Algebra:** Portfolio optimization, covariance matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors (PCA).
- **Statistics:** Mean, variance, correlation, regression analysis.
- **Optimization:** Risk-return tradeoff, efficient frontier.

## Example Applications

- Constructing and optimizing a portfolio using the Markowitz model.
- Analyzing asset correlations with covariance matrices.
- Dimensionality reduction of financial data using PCA.
